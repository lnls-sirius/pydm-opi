#### Manually

This repository depends on [PyDM](https://github.com/slaclab/pydm),
[PyEPICS](https://github.com/pyepics/pyepics), [conscommon](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/cons-common) and python>=3.6.
Dependencies listed at `requirements.txt`.

Clone from master or download the latest release. Optionally the user may clone recursive in order to pull the module `conscommon`. If so, install the submodule using `cd cons-common && pip install .`.

### EPICS Base
Install EPICS and add it to PATH(Windows only)
```
https://epics.anl.gov/download/distributions/EPICSWindowsTools1.44-x64.msi
```
For linux users the recommended way is to compile the latest LTS release of the [EPICS Base (R3.15.8)](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/tree/3.15).
After the compilation is completed, the `bin` folder must be added to the environment `PATH` and the `lib` folder to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

### Sirius Environment
To install in a machine managed by [lnls-sirius/lnls-ansible](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/lnls-ansible) clone the repo recursively and make install as sudo.
```bash
cd ~/ && git clone --recursive https://github.com/lnls-sirius/pydm-opi && cd pydm-opi && sudo make install
```

### Desktop
In order to install the `.desktop` launcher:
```bash
make install-files
```
If using conda, remember to fix the Exec entry at the `.desktop' file accordingly:
```bash
/bin/bash -c 'source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate cons && sirius-hla-as-ap-conlauncher.py'
```

Run
---
All scripts used to start the applications should be at the `bin` folder relative to the python installation environment, for example:
```bash
~/.local/bin
/usr/local/bin
...
```

To launch the main window use the script: `sirius-hla-as-ap-conlauncher.py`

### Windows
There should be no problems running on windows.
